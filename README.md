## Description

This project involves developing a simple calculator to estimate two variables:

1.  **Final livestock weight after 30 days:** This value is estimated using the calfâ€™s initial fattening weight and its Average Daily Gain (ADG).
2.  **Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR):** This indicator is used by farm managers to evaluate feed efficiency.
