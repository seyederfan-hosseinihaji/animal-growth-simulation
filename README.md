## Description

This project involves developing a simple calculator to estimate two variables:

1.  **Final livestock weight after 30 days:** This value is estimated using the calf’s initial fattening weight and its Average Daily Gain (ADG).
2.  **Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR):** This indicator is used by farm managers to evaluate feed efficiency. FCR = feed intake ÷ weight gain

## Example Input

InitialFatteningWeight \<- 220 kg

DailyGain \<- 1.2 kg/day

TotalFeedIntake \<- 240 kg
